# Encryption-Web-App

This is a web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt strings using AES encryption. The application is built entirely on the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Encrypt plaintext strings using AES encryption.
- Decrypt encrypted strings back to their original plaintext form.
- No backend server or database required. All encryption and decryption are performed in the browser using JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Encryption

1. Enter the plaintext string you want to encrypt in the text area.
2. Click the "Encrypt" button.
3. The encrypted value will be displayed in the output section below the input area.

### Decryption

1. Enter the encrypted string you want to decrypt in the text area.
2. Click the "Decrypt" button.
3. The decrypted value will be displayed in the output section below the input area.

## Important Notes

- This web application is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It does not guarantee the highest level of security and should not be used for sensitive data encryption in production environments.
- The encryption and decryption operations are performed entirely in the browser using JavaScript. No data is sent to a server, and no data is stored or logged.
- Always use strong and secure encryption keys when dealing with sensitive data.
